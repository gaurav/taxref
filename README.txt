TAXREF
Taxonomic Referencing made easy

1. INTRODUCTION

TaxRef is designed to meet three needs:
    1.  Taxonomic validation: given a list of potentially correct
        taxon names, identify the currently accepted name corresponding
        to that taxon name, or record the name as being invalid.
        e.g. given "Fellis tigris", validate the name as a mistype of
        "Felis tigris", which is a junior synonym of "Panthera tigris".
    2.  Taxonomic referencing: given a valid taxon name, fill in
        higher taxonomy corresponding to that name. Note that this
        will need to be against a particular taxonomic checklist.
        e.g. given "Panthera tigris", identify the family ("Felidae"),
        order ("Carnivora"), class ("Mammalia"), phylum ("Chordata"),
        kingdom ("Animalia") and optionally domain ("Eukarya").
    3.  Checklist comparison: given multiple taxonomic checklists,
        identify differences between them and provide summaries as
        to those differences.
        e.g. one checklist might have "80% (n=4) of the names in
        genus 'Panthera'" as the other checklist.
